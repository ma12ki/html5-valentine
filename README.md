# Valentine
A simple project I put together a while back to test out some of the features of HTML5 canvas and CSS3.

### Usage
Just clone the project and run `valentine.html` in your browser. Or send it to the one you love.

### Browser compatibility
I deliberately omitted all vendor prefixes for CSS3 attributes to keep the code as clean and as readable as possible, so there might be some issues on older browsers.
Tested in Firefox 44 and Chrome 48.
